# Mitochondrial_Genomes

This repository includes scripts and drafts from assembling and analyzing mitochondrial genomes. 
The first is a combined script detailing MIRA and Mitobim. 
MIRA is a read trimmer and genome mapper. The genome we used to map was of Akodon montensis, and we gave it raw reads. 
Mitobim is a genome assembler, which took the reads and data produced from MIRA to do so. 
After are subsequent drafts of the paper, one of which is taken from Systematics class. 
These drafts should be used to compare my writing to Neal and Dr. Ray's, and to improve thereupon.
